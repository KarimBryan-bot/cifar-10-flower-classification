# Flower Classification Using CNN

# Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of flowers into multiple categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained to extract visual features from flower images and accurately classify them into different species.

# Dataset
- Description: The dataset contains labeled images of flowers from multiple classes (e.g., daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip).
- Source: (Add dataset source link here, e.g., Kaggle Flowers Recognition dataset)
- Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized to [0, 1], and optionally augmented to improve model generalization.

# Model Architecture
- CNN constructed with layers such as:
  - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling for feature extraction.
  - Flattening layer to convert 2D features into 1D vector.
  - Fully connected (dense) layers for classification.
  - Output layer with softmax activation corresponding to the number of flower classes.

# Installation

# Usage
1. Load and preprocess the flower dataset.
2. Define and compile the CNN model:
3. Train the model:
4. Evaluate the model on test data and visualize results.

# Results
- Summarize accuracy and loss.
- Optionally include plots of training history and confusion matrix.

## Future Work
- Experiment with deeper or pre-trained CNN architectures.
- Apply advanced augmentation techniques.
- Deploy as a web or mobile application.
